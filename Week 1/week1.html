   <h2>Week 1 Exercises</h2>
   <p>I followed the example for the local storage section, as a refresher, in the Doing Stuff with Web Things reading, with a few adjustments
      to the code. I also put the Javascript and CSS in separate files.</p>

   <h2>Week 1 Notes</h2>
   <h4>Doing Stuff with Web Things</h4>
   <p>How long will the files stay in local storage?</p>
   <p>How much can local storage hold?</p>
   <p>How reliable/easy to lose things?</p>
   <p>How to delete from local storage?</p>

   <h4>Master Mobile UX</h4>
   <p>Mobile first design - easier to scale up than down.</p>
   <p>Reachablitiy - I have never really thought about how people hold their phones before. This was interesting to think
      and to realize that some sites already do a bottom menu.</p>
   <p>Speed - reduce images, SVG/Webfonts lower bandwidth, optimize/minify CSS, GZIP files</p>
