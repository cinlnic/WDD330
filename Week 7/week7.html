      <h2>Week 7 Notes</h2>
      <h3>Further Functions</h3>
      <h4>Functions Properties and Methods</h4>
      <p>Functions are first class objects - they can have properties and methods themselves</p>
      <p>Call and Apply Methods <br> call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object
         that is
         provided as the first argument. <br> apply() works the same as call, expcept the arguments are provided as an
         array</p>
      <p>Custom properties are added to functions the same way as to objects</p>
      <h4>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h4>
      <p>an anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it's defined <br> can be used to assign temporary variables,
         initialization code, using strict mode,
         creating self contained code blocks</p>
      <h4>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h4>
      <p>Functions can call, define, and rewrite themselves. This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a
         variable that the same name as the funtion</p>
      <h4>Recursive Functions</h4>
      <p>invokes itself until a certain condition is met</p>
      <h4>Callbacks</h4>
      <p>Can be used to facilitate event driven asynchronous programming</p>
      <p>Promise <br> represents the future result of an ansynchronous operation <br> created using a constructor
         function</p>
      <h4>Closures</h4>
      <p>a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another function, but is then kept alive and
         used in another part of the program</p>
      <h3>Ajax</h3>
      <p>a technique that allows web pages to dynamically update without reloading</p>
      <p>acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript XML</p>
      <h4>The Fetch API</h4>
      <p>standard for requesting and sending data asynchronously across a network</p>
      <p>global fetch() method with a mandatory argument, the URL you want to fetch</p>
      <p>Response Interface - deals with the object that's returned when the promise is fullfilled<br>
          has properties and methods that allow us to process the response effectively</p>
      <p>Request Interface - more control over the request by providing a request object as an argument <br>
      created using the Request() constructor</p>
      <p>Headers Interface - can be used to create a headers object, then added as a property of Request and Response objects</p>
